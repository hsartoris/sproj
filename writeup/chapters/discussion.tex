\section{Potential Improvements}

\subsection{Algorithm}
Detail issues with summing inputs and outputs, and propose alternative algorithm 
here. Note issues with implementation.

\subsection{Optimizer}
I think it's in the paper about ELU or SELU that they use a ramping up learn 
rate and then decline. That might be ideal for the original, concatenation-based 
implemenation of the network, to avoid pushing it down the gradient too fast and 
zeroing out the convolutional matrix sections.
