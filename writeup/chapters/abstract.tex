A ubiquitous problem within the field of computational neuroscience is the 
determination of biological neural network structure and connectivity from 
imaging of stochastic, large-scale network activity. We propose a machine 
learning algorithm inspired by convolutional approaches to image processing, 
adapted to the graph structure of neural networks. To achieve this, we redefine 
locality in terms of graph adjacency, and create a scale-independent algorithm 
facilitated by modern machine learning techniques to incorporate this locality 
data into individual connection prediction.
