\chapter{Architecture}
Our model can be broadly described as convolutional, as it is entirely 
\textit{n}-independent, relying instead on the application of matrices at each 
layer to all possible pairs within \textit{n}. Beyond this, the model also 
incorporates data from adjacent nodes in its evaluation of a given potential 
edge, meaning that another important aspect of convolution, locality, is 
included.
