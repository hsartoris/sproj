\chapter{Introduction}

Artifical neural network-based solutions emerging in recent years have become a 
preeminent method for achieving accurate reconstructions of biological neural 
networks.\cite{Ray2015} However, the methods used tend to not take advantage of 
features unique to biological neural networks that can assist in producing 
reconstructions.  We present an architecture for determining network structure 
inspired by convolutional neural networks.  Whereas in image processing, the 
typical use case for convolutional networks, pixel and feature adjacency 
correlates with shared meaning, there exists no such metric for data extracted 
from biological neural networks, as per-neuron spike trains can be reconfigured 
into various permutations without necessitating a change in the structure of the 
network that generated those spikes. Thus our architecture redefines adjacency 
to a version more suited to the unique features of biological neural networks, 
derived from locality within the original graph structure.
