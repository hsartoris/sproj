\section{3-neuron generator}
\label{results_3neur}
We first consider a generator network consisting of three nodes connected as in 
FIGURE HERE (should contain visual structure and adjacency matrix). All weights 
are binary, and a spike rate of .25 was used.\footnote{SEE APPENDIX	for 
information on spike rates}

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\input{../resources/2simplex.tex}\hspace{2em}
	\begin{tabular}{l|lll}
		  & 0 & 1 & 2\\
		\hline
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
		1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
		2 & 1 & 1 & 0
	\end{tabular}
	\captionof{figure}{Network structure and adjacency matrix of the generator.}

\end{table}

While reconstructing a graph comprising only three nodes is not much of a feat, 
this simplified case allows us to demonstrate that our convolutional approach is 
capable of reconstruction at all. Furthermore, the small network size requires 
few timesteps and a small interlayer featurespace; i.e., $b,d<10$. This results 
in a relatively simple set of transitions, allowing us to explore and understand 
the inner workings of the network.
