\section{3-neuron generator}
We first consider a generator network consisting of three nodes connected as in 
FIGURE HERE (should contain visual structure and adjacency matrix). All weights 
are binary, and a spike rate of .25 was used.


While reconstructing a graph comprising only three nodes is not much of a feat, 
this simplified case allows us to demonstrate that our convolutional approach is 
capable of reconstruction at all. Furthermore,
