	abstract = {Two-photon calcium imaging is a powerful means for monitoring the activity of distinct neurons in brain tissue in vivo. In the mammalian brain, such imaging studies have been restricted largely to calcium recordings from neurons that were individually dye-loaded through microelectrodes. Previous attempts to use membrane-permeant forms of fluorometric calcium indicators to load populations of neurons have yielded satisfactory results only in cell cultures or in slices of immature brain tissue. Here we introduce a versatile approach for loading membrane-permeant fluorescent indicator dyes in large populations of cells. We established a pressure ejection-based local dye delivery protocol that can be used for a large spectrum of membrane-permeant indicator dyes, including calcium green-1 acetoxymethyl (AM) ester, Fura-2 AM, Fluo-4 AM, and Indo-1 AM. We applied this dye-loading protocol successfully in mouse brain tissue at any developmental stage from newborn to adult in vivo and in vitro. In vivo two-photon Ca2+ recordings, obtained by imaging through the intact skull, indicated that whisker deflection-evoked Ca2+ transients occur in a subset of layer 2/3 neurons of the barrel cortex. Thus, our results demonstrate the suitability of this technique for real-time analyses of intact neuronal circuits with the resolution of individual cells.},

@article{Reimann2017,
abstract = {The lack of a formal link between neural network structure and its emergent function has hampered our understanding of how the brain processes information. We have now come closer to describing such a link by taking the direction of synaptic transmission into account, constructing graphs of a network that reflect the direction of information flow, and analyzing these directed graphs using algebraic topology. Applying this approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical sequence towards peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.},

	abstract = {The functional properties of neural circuits become increasingly robust over development. This allows circuits to optimize their output in response to a variety of input. However, it is not clear whether this optimization is a function of hardwired circuit elements, or whether it requires neural experience to develop. We performed rapid in vivo imaging of calcium signals from bulk-labeled neurons in the Xenopus laevis optic tectum to resolve the rapid spatiotemporal response properties of populations of developing tectal neurons in response to visual stimuli. We found that during a critical time in tectal development, network activity becomes increasingly robust, more correlated, and more synchronous. These developmental changes require normal visual input during development and are disrupted by NMDAR blockade. Our data show that visual activity and NMDAR activation are critical for the maturation of tectal network dynamics during visual system development.},

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined {\textquotedblleft}network motifs,{\textquotedblright} patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

@article{Ray2015,
abstract = {Brain science is a frontier research area with great promise for understanding, preventing, and treating multiple diseases affecting millions of patients. Its key task of reconstructing neuronal brain connectivity poses unique Big Data Analysis challenges distinct from those in clinical or "-omics" domains. Our goal is to understand the strengths and limitations of reconstruction algorithms, measure performance and its determinants, and ultimately enhance performance and applicability. We devised a set of experiments in a well-controlled setting using an established gold-standard based on calcium fluorescence time series recordings of thousands of neurons sampled from a previously validated neuronal model of complex time-varying causal neuronal connections. Following empirical testing of several state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, and using the best-performing algorithms, we constructed features of a classifier and predicted the presence or absence of connections using meta-learning. This approach combines information-theoretic, feature construction, and pattern recognition meta-learning methods to considerably improve the Area under ROC curve performance. Our data are very promising toward the feasibility of reliably reconstructing complex neuronal connectivity.},
